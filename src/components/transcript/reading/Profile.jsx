          By day I'm a regular guy and by night a superhero ... How tiring is
          that?!

          Just joking! I'm a regular guy all the time, good job, close to my
          family, just bought my own flat with a cat. Actually, my cat thinks
          I'm a hero because I saved her from the street. I'm a talkative person
          and I believe communication is the most important thing in a
          relationship.

          I love pizza if it's Italian, wine if it's white, and football if it's
          the World Cup. I read a lot, especially true life stories, but most of
          my books live on my phone.

          I love to travel and I'm always planning my next trip. I prefer an
          active holiday like hiking, skiing or watersports and I get bored
          lying on the beach. I post lots of photos on Instagram as I'm a good
          photographer but I'd really love to share the holiday with someone.
          Maybe you'll take the photos on the next trip.{" "}
